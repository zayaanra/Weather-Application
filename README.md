# Weather-Application

A weather application designed with aspects of Scala/JavaFX to fetch JSON data from an OpenWeather API. Other functionality includes a SinglyLinkedList implementation that will be used to store Weather data fetched by the user. This implementation would also serve to let the user see the contents of which data from which locations they have fetched thus far.
